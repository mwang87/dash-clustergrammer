# Clustergrammer for Dash

Clustergrammer for Dash is a [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) component library implementing [Clustergrammer](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017151).

The code was created with help from Amir Alavi's post in [this Dash forum thread](https://community.plotly.com/t/using-external-js-libraries-in-custom-dash-component/11653/11).

Running the example application:
1. Install Dash and its dependencies: https://dash.plotly.com/installation
2. Run `python usage.py`
3. Visit http://localhost:8050 in your web browser

## Incorporating into your own application

The ``usage.py`` script provides an example for how to use this component in a Dash application.

Note that the component's package is the directory ``dash_clustergrammer``. This package's location can be added to your ``PYTHONPATH`` in order to incorporate Clustergrammer into your application.
